# Impossible SpacesVR
Impossible Spaces VR is a game made in Unity where the player walks around a spaceship in Virtual Reality (VR). The unique aspect of this project is that the corridors and rooms shouldn't be physically possible. This effect is achieved by overlapping the spaces and using Stencil Shaders to hide and show rooms dynamically, even when they are not physically there.

## Features
- **Impossible Spaces**: Experience spaces that defy physical constraints using a clever combination of room overlap and shader techniques.
- **Stencil Shaders**: Advanced shader usage to hide and reveal areas of the spaceship, giving the impression of seamless but impossible transitions between rooms.
- **Immersive VR Environment**: Explore a futuristic spaceship with fully immersive VR support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2021.3 or later
- A VR headset (Oculus, HTC Vive, or compatible)
- Compatible PC setup for VR development

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Impossible-spaces-VR.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Connect your VR headset.
4. Build and run the game for your desired VR platform.

## Controls
- Use your VR headset controllers to move around the spaceship.
- Interact with objects and navigate through impossible corridors.

## How It Works
This project utilizes **Stencil Shaders** to create spaces that should not be physically possible in real life. Rooms are overlapped, and shaders are used to selectively hide or reveal sections of the ship based on the playerâ€™s location, giving the illusion of endless space in a finite area.
